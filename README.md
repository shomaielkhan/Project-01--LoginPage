**VWO login page**
In this project, I have performed exploratory testing on the login page to ensure it is free of defects and errors. 
The login Page is the most important and initially crucial stage for the success of the application and for creating an impact on the user. If this part, fails to deliver to the user, it will discourage the user from opening the page.

After analyzing the application in this project, I have developed several test case scenarios. 
I also created a bug reporting on the defects I confronted while testing.
